Ok so basically, I'm
creating a pythhon program designed to scrape images (such as box art title screens and manuals) and video files (gameplay or possibly a trailer) of a rom collection.
I decided to make it myself because using other scraping apps it seems they would not recognize many games due to slight naming variations, and I have a bit of spare time for this interesting challenge.
